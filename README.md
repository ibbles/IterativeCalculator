# IterativeCalculator

A script based calculator with an Octave backend.

IterativeCalculator is an Octave script editor that displays the Octave output
as the user types. The intended use case is for quick throw-away exploratory
computations where the problem isn't understood well enough for the Octave
shell and creating files and re-running Octave by hand several times is too
much overhead.
